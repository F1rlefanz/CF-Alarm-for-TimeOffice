   SECURITY-HARDENED Full Backup Rules (Android 6.0-11 compatibility)
   
   PRINCIPLE: Include only safe data, exclude ALL sensitive data
   SECURITY IMPACT: Prevents token leakage through legacy backup mechanisms
   
   Note: This file is used for Android 6.0 to 11 (API 23-30)
   For Android 12+ (API 31+), see data_extraction_rules.xml

    <!-- SIMPLIFIED APPROACH: Include only explicitly safe data -->
    <!-- No wildcards or exclusions of non-included paths -->
    
    <!-- Safe app configuration that can be backed up -->
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="shift_config.xml"/>
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="alarm_settings.xml"/>
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="ui_preferences.xml"/>
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="app_preferences.xml"/>
    
    <!-- Safe app database (non-sensitive user data) -->
    <include domain="database" path="app_database.db"/>
    
    <!-- Note: By not including sensitive paths, they are automatically excluded -->
    <!-- This approach is Lint-compliant and secure -->
